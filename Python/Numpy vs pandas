- Pandas is built on Numpy
- Numpy workds with Numerical data, while pandas work on both numerical and non-numerical data
- Numpy has Mathematical functions
- Mathematical Functions in Numpy would work fine in Pandas as well, but there are some non-mathematical functions in Pandas that are for non-numerical data!
