# What is EDA
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves using graphics and visualizations to explore and analyze a dataset.
- EDA can be used for data cleaning
- Subgroup analyses
- for understanding your data better
- With EDA, you can find anomalies in your data, such as outliers or unusual observations
- uncover patterns
- understand potential relationships among variables
- generate interesting questions or hypotheses that you can test later using more formal statistical methods
- the distribution of variables in your dataset. That is, what is the shape of your data? Is the distribution normal? Does it have a fat tail? Is it skewed? Is it bimodal?
- whether or not your data have outliers or unusual points. This may indicate data quality issues or lead to interesting insights.
# Data Exploration
It often gives us the first glance at what is important in our data and what is garbage.

Data Exploration consists of the following parts:

## 1. Univariate exploration - exploring one variable at a time:
- Explanatory variables (variables we will use for modeling)
- Target variable (if applicable)

## 2. Multivariate exploration - exploring more than one variable at the same time:
- Manual – using domain knowledge
- Automatical – using Math
