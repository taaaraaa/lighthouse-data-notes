**LOSS FUNCTION**

We need to know how far our model is from the actual values. This function measures how far an estimated value of a quantity is from the true value. 

**RISK FUNCTION**

We calculate the risk function by taking the expected value of the loss function.

**Arg Min**

We are looking for a function h from a pool of functions H that minimizes the risk function.
