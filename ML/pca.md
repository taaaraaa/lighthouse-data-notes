## Why Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of features) can result in:

- Visualizations (2-3 dimensional plots)
- Lower computational complexity (time and space)
- Improve model performance (e.g. accuracy)
- Avoid over-fitting

## How can we reduce the number of features?

1. Dimensionality reduction (transform features into a lower dimension using linear algebra)
    - PCA: Principal Component Analysis
    - LDA

2. Variable selection (simply selecting or excluding certain variables)

    - Filter methods
    - Wrapper methods

## What is PCA?
PCA represents many variables with fewer variables while minimizing loss of information!
