# Type of variables
## 1. Categorical
- Ordinal
- Nominal
## 2. Numerical 
- Discrete
- Continuouse

Other type for deviding it (level of measurement): 
- Ratio--- have a true zero
- Interval 

## Graphs and tables for Categorical variables
- Frequency Distribution Table
- Bar Charts
    - Side-by-side barchart
- Pie Charts
- Pareto diagrams 


## Graphs and tables for Numerical variables
- Frequency distribution table
- Histogram
- Scatter plot (two numerical variables on the same graph)

# Measures of Central Tendency
## 1. Mean 
- Population average >> μ
- Sample Average >> X̄
- Number of Pop >> N
- number of Sample >> n

### Downside of Mean
- Easily affected by outliers, so not enough to make definite conclusions

## 2. Median
The middle number in a data set (n+1/2)
## 3. Mode
# Skewness / Asymmetry
It indicates wether the data is concentrated on one side!
## 1. Right Skew 
-  It is tailing to the right side. 
- Mean> Median
- Outliers are on the right side

## 2. Zero Skew / No skew 
- Mean=median=mode
- Distribution is symmetrical
## 3. Left Skew/ Negative Skew
- Mean < Median
- Outliers on the left

# Measures of Variablities
- Variance
- Standard deviation
- Coefficient of Variation


## 1. Variance
- Population σ^2
- Sample 𝑠^2

## 2. Standard deviation
- Population σ
- Sample 𝑠
## 3. Coefficient of Variation = Relative Standard Deviation
Standard deviation relative to the mean
- CV
- Population σ/μ
- Sample 𝑠/X̄
### Why CV?
- Does not have a unit of measurement
- Universal across datasets
- Perfect for comparisons

# Relationships between Variables
## 1. Covariance: Cov
- Negative
- Zero
- Positive
- Sample: Sxy
- Pop: σxy

## 2. Linear Correlation Coefficient 
-1=<Correlation Coeffiecint <=1

It is calculated be this formula:

Cov (x,y) / (Stdev(x)*Stdev(y))
