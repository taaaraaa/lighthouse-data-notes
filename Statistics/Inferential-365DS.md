# Distribution
## 1. Normal = Bell Curve distribution
- Symmetrical
- mean=median=mode
## 2. Binomial
## 3. Discrete Uniform Distribution
Rolling a dice once >> probabality of getting 1 to 6 are equal
## 4. Exponential

.


# 1. Normal Distribution

## Standardization:
it is much easier to run models in standarized distribution. Any normal distribution can be normalized!

To make a  **Standard Normal Distribution**  we use letter Z:
- We shift the mean to 0

and
- Making the Standard deviation to be 1

z ~ N(0,1)

- The standardization variable is called the z-score

# The Central Limit Theorem
Go [here](/notes.md#the-central-limit-theorem)
### Sampling distribution
N ~ (μ,σ^2/n)

#### Standard Error = SE = Standard deviaton of the sampling distribution 
That is: σ/ radical n

# Estimators and Estimates
## Types of Estimates:
1. Point Estimates >>>> a number

Examples:

    - sample mean (X̄) >>> Population mean (μ)
    - Variance of sample >>> Variance of pop

2. Confidence Intervals : it is an interval

- Point estimate is located at the middle of the confidence interval!
