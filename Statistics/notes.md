# The Central Limit Theorem
The essential concept of the central limit theorem is that the average of our samples' means will be the population mean. In other words, if we add up the means from all of our samples and find the average, that average will be our actual population mean. Similarly, if we find the average of the standard deviations of our samples, we will find the actual standard deviation for our population. It is a pretty useful phenomenon that can help us accurately predict the characteristics of a population.

With hypothesis testing, It is important to select the right test for each problem. The tricky part is that there is no error produced if you choose the wrong test, youâ€™ll just have incorrect results.

# Python Libraries for Statistical Models
1. NumPy
``` python
import numpy as np
```
2. Matplotlib ( for Visualization)
``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
3. Seaborn
4. SciPy for inferential statistics

5. Statsmodels for advanced modeling
``` python
import statsmodels.api as sm
```

6. Scikit-learn for statistical learning


# Model types
## 1.  Regression Model

Regression algorithms are used to determine continuous values such as price, income, age, etc.

- **Simple Linear Regression:** This type is the least complicated form of regression, where there is a single independent variable that is continuous.

- **Multiple Linear Regression:** This is an extension of simple linear regression, where there are at least two continuous independent variables.

## 2. Classification Model

Classification algorithms are used to forecast or classify distinct values such as True or False, Spam or Not Spam, etc.
