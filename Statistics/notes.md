# The Central Limit Theorem
The essential concept of the central limit theorem is that the average of our samples' means will be the population mean. In other words, if we add up the means from all of our samples and find the average, that average will be our actual population mean. Similarly, if we find the average of the standard deviations of our samples, we will find the actual standard deviation for our population. It is a pretty useful phenomenon that can help us accurately predict the characteristics of a population.

With hypothesis testing, It is important to select the right test for each problem. The tricky part is that there is no error produced if you choose the wrong test, youâ€™ll just have incorrect results.
